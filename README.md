# Clima-WeatherApp
This is the light weight Weather Application.
Which provides the the weather for your current Location.
you can Access the curent temperature by two methods 
first by Allowing Access of GPS Location to the app or By entering the City Name Manually.
I have used AsynchronousHTTP Library in it for making the connection between the app and server.
This app uses OpenWeather API for Providing the real time WeatherData.
feel free to use this app.
you can also modify it just make a pull request :)
